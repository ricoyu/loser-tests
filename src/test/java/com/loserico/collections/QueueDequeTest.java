/**
 * Queues and double-ended queues (deque; pronounced "deck")
 * 
 * A queue is a collection of elements to be processed
 * 
 * Queues have a distinct set of characteristics and behaviors, where the insertion of
 * a new element in a queue is called enqueuing and the atomic retrieval and removal
 * of the next element from the queue is called dequeuing. If we wish to retrieve the
 * next element from a queue without removing it from the queue, we can peek at the
 * queue, which results in the next element from the queue but leaves it in the queue.
 * Although not all queues are formed in the same manner, the most common type of
 * queue (such as in the supermarket or drive-through examples) is the
 * First-in-First-out (FIFO) queue.
