 * changes so that it can update its list-of-files display when files are created or
 * deleted.

		 * message stating this fact is output. Otherwise, WatchEvent’s T context()
		 * method is called to return the event context, which is subsequently output.
		 * For ENTRY_CREATE, ENTRY_DELETE, and ENTRY_MODIFY events, the context is a
