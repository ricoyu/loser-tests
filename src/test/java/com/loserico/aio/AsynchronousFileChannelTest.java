	/**
	 * AsynchronousFileChannels don’t belong to groups. However, they are associated
	 * with a thread pool to which tasks are submitted, to handle I/O events and to
	 * dispatch to completion handlers that consume the results of I/O operations on
	 * the channel.
	 * 
	 * The completion handler for an I/O operation initiated on a channel is
	 * guaranteed to be invoked by one of the threads in the thread pool, which
	 * ensures that the completion handler is run by a thread with the expected
	 * identity. If an I/O operation completes immediately and the initiating thread
	 * is itself a thread in the thread pool, the completion handler may be invoked
	 * directly by the initiating thread.
	 * 
	 * When an asynchronous file channel is created without specifying a thread pool,
	 * the channel is associated with a system-dependent default thread pool that may
	 * be shared with other channels. The default thread pool is configured by the
	 * system properties defined by AsynchronousChannelGroup.
	 * 
	 * An asynchronous file channel created by AsynchronousFileChannel’s
	 * AsynchronousFileChannel open(Path file, OpenOption... options) class method is
	 * associated with the default thread pool. You can associate a file channel with
	 * another thread pool by calling the AsynchronousFileChannel open(Path file,
	 * Set<? extends OpenOption> options, ExecutorService executor,
	 * FileAttribute<?>... attrs) class method. Here, executor identifies the desired
	 * thread pool.
