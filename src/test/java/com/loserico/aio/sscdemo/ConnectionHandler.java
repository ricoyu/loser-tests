	/*
	 * The completed() method’s first task is to obtain and output the client’s socket
	 * address for identification. I specified channelClient. getRemoteAddress()
	 * instead of channelClient.getLocalAddress() to return the client’s socket
	 * address because the socket corresponding to channelClient was created on the
	 * server side and it communicates with the client-side socket. Calling
	 * getLocalAddress() on channelClient returns the server-side socket address.
	 * Calling getRemoteAddress() on channelClient returns the client-side socket
	 * address.
	 * 
	 * Next, completed() calls accept() on the server socket channel with the passed
	 * Attachment object and a reference to the current completion handler as
	 * arguments. This call allows the server to respond to the next incoming
	 * connection.
	 * 
	 * The accept() method is called on the server socket channel referenced from the
	 * Attachment object passed to completed(). This same object is passed as the
	 * first argument to accept(). None of the other fields in the Attachment object
	 * have been initialized because they aren’t required. This Attachment object is
	 * only needed to identify the server socket channel.
	 * 
	 * After calling accept(), a second Attachment object is created and initialized
	 * in preparation for reading from the client. Also, a ReadWriteHandler object is
	 * created to respond to the read operation. The new Attachment object’s byte
	 * buffer, the new Attachment object, and the ReadWriteHandler object are passed
	 * as arguments to the client socket channel’s read() method.
