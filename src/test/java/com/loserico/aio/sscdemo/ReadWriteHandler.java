/**
 * ReadWriteHandler is a CompletionHandler that responds to read() or write() method
 * completions. Its completed() method is called to respond to a successful read() or
 * write(), which includes issuing a counterpart write() or read(). Its failed()
 * method is called when the client breaks off its connection with the server.

	/*
	 * The completed() method’s first task is to respond to a read() call that returns
	 * -1, which indicates that no bytes could be read because end-ofstream has been
	 * reached. (The client may have terminated before writing data.) It closes the
	 * client socket channel, outputs a message to indicate that the server is no
	 * longer listening to the client, and returns.
	 * 
	 * Assuming that the read/write handler is operating in read mode (true), the
	 * buffer contents are flipped and extracted to a bytes array, which is
	 * subsequently converted to a string that is output.
	 * 
	 * The read/write handler is then configured for write mode by assigning false to
	 * isReadMode, the buffer is rewound in preparation for being written, and the
	 * buffer along with the attachment and current completion handler are passed to
	 * the client socket channel’s write() method so that the buffer contents can be
	 * sent to the client.
	 * 
	 * After a successful write operation, the read/write handler’s completed() method
	 * is called. Because isReadMode is no longer true, the else part of the if-else
	 * statement executes. It toggles isReadMode to true, clears the buffer, and
	 * initiates a read operation to read from the client. This pattern continues
	 * until the client presents nothing more to read and the completion handler can
	 * terminate. (This latter scenario will probably never happen.)
