/**
 * The below is the ThreadPool class used to create pool of threads and allow a
 * thread to fetch and execute the job from the job queue.
 * 
 * The above class is used to create n threads (worker threads). Each worker thread
 * will wait for a job in a queue and then execute the job and will go back to
 * waiting state. The class contains a job queue; when a new job will be added into
 * the queue, a worker thread from the pool will execute the job.
 * 
 * We also include a shutdownPool method which will used to shut down the pool by
 * interrupting all the worker threads only when the job queue is empty. The addJob
 * method is used to add jobs to the queues.
