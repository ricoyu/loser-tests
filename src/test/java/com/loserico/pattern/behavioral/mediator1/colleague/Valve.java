/**
 * The Valve class has two methods, an open() method which is called to open the valve
 * and when the water is filled it called the closed() method. But please note that it
 * is not calling the closed() method directly, it calls the closed() method of the
 * mediator which invokes the method of this class. On closing the valve it turns the
 * heater on but again by invoking the mediator’s method instead of directly calling
 * the heater’s method.
