/**
 * There is another form of the Builder Pattern other than what we have seen so far.
 * Sometimes there is an object with a long list of properties, and most of these
 * properties are optional. Consider an online form which needs to be filled in
 * order to become a member of a site. You need to fill all the mandatory fields but
 * you can skip the optional fields or sometimes it may look valuable to fill some
 * of the optional fields.
 * 
 * Please check the below Form class which contains long list of properties and some
 * of the properties are optional.
 * 
 * It is mandatory to have firstName, lastName, userName, and password in the form
 * but all others are optional fields.
 * 
 * The question is, what sort of constructor should we write for such a class? Well
 * writing a constructor with long list of parameters is not a good choice, this
 * could frustrate the client especially if the important fields are only a few.
 * This could increase the scope of error; the client may provide a value
 * accidentally to a wrong field.
 * 
 * Another way is to use telescoping constructors, in which you provide a
 * constructor with only the required parameters, another with a single optional
 * parameter, a third with two optional parameters, and so on, culminating in a
 * constructor with all the optional parameters.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public Form(String firstName,String lastName){
 *		this(firstName,lastName,null,null);
 * }
	
 * public Form(String firstName,String lastName,String userName,String password){
 * 		this(firstName,lastName,userName,password,null,null);
 * }
	
 * public Form(String firstName,String lastName,String userName,String password,String address,Date dob){
 * 		this(firstName,lastName,userName,password,address,dob,null,null);
 * }
 * 
 * public Form(String firstName,String lastName,String userName,String password,String address,Date dob,String email,String backupEmail){
 * 		…
 * }
 * 
 * </pre>
 * 
 * When you want to create an instance, you use the constructor with the shortest
 * parameter list containing all the parameters you want to set.
 * 
 * The telescoping constructor works, but it is hard to write client code when there
 * are many parameters, and it is even harder to read it. The reader is left
 * wondering what all those values mean and must carefully count parameters to find
 * out. Long sequences of identically typed parameters can cause subtle bugs. If the
 * client accidentally reverses two such parameters, the compiler won’t complain,
 * but the program will misbehave at runtime.
 * 
 * A second alternative when you are faced with many constructor parameters is the
 * JavaBeans pattern, in which you call a parameter less constructor to create the
 * object and then call setter methods to set each required parameter and each
 * optional parameter of interest.
 * 
 * Unfortunately, the JavaBeans pattern has serious disadvantages of its own.
 * Because construction is split across multiple calls, a JavaBean may be in an
 * inconsistent state partway through its construction. The class does not have the
 * option of enforcing consistency merely by checking the validity of the
 * constructor parameters. Attempting to use an object when it’s in an inconsistent
 * state may cause failures that are far removed from the code containing the bug,
 * hence difficult to debug.
 * 
 * There is a third alternative that combines the safety of the telescoping
 * constructor pattern with the readability of the JavaBeans pattern. It is a form
 * of the Builder pattern. Instead of making the desired object directly, the client
 * calls a constructor with all of the required parameters and gets a builder
 * object. Then the client calls setter-like methods on the builder object to set
 * each optional parameter of interest. Finally, the client calls a parameter less
 * build method to generate the object.
