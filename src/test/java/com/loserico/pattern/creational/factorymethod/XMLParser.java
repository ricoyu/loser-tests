/**
 * In todayâ€™s modern world, everyone is using software to facilitate their jobs.
 * Recently, a product company has shifted the way they used to take orders from
 * their clients. The company is now looking to use an application to take orders
 * from them. They receive orders, errors in orders, feedback for the previous
 * order, and responses to the order in an XML format. The company has asked you to
 * develop an application to parse the XML and display the result to them.
 * 
 * The main challenge for you is to parse an XML and display its content to the
 * user. There are different XML formats depending on the different types of
 * messages the company receives from its clients. Like, for example, an order type
 * XML has different sets of xml tags as compared to the response or error XML. But
 * the core job is the same; that is, to display to the user the message being
 * carried in these XMLs. 
 * 
 * Although the core job is the same, the object that would
 * be used varies according to the kind of XML the application gets from the user.
 * So, an application object may only know that it needs to access a class from
 * within the class hierarchy (hierarchy of different parsers), but does not know
 * exactly which class from among the set of subclasses of the parent class is to be
 * selected. 
 * 
 * In this case, it is better to provide a factory, i.e. a factory to
 * create parsers, and at runtime a parser gets instantiated to do the job,
 * according to the kind of XML the application receives from the user.
