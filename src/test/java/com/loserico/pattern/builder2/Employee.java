	 * What Is the Builder Pattern?
	 * 
	 * Keep in mind that if your class has multiple attributes with the same type or
	 * optional when you design your class, it is time to consider the Builder
	 * Pattern. If now, you may want to add more parameters to your class, then it
	 * is never too late to consider refactoring your code with the Builder pattern.
	 * 
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>First of all, you need to create a public static nested class, which has
	 * all the instance attributes from the outer class. The naming convention for
	 * Builder usually is that and if the class name is Employee, then the builder
	 * class should be named as EmployeeBuilder.
	 * 
	 * <li>The outer class Employee should have a private constructor that takes a
	 * EmployeeBuilder object as its argument.
	 * 
	 * <li>The builder class should have a public constructor with all the required
	 * attributes as parameters and these required attributes are defined as
	 * "final," which have setter methods to set the optional parameters. It should
	 * return the same Builder object after setting the optional attribute.
	 * 
	 * <li>The final step is to provide a build() method in the builder class that
	 * will return the outer class object to the client. This build() method will
	 * call the private constructor in the outer class, passing the Builder object
	 * itself as the parameter to this private constructor.
	 * 
	 * <li>The Employee class has only getter methods and no public constructor. So,
	 * the only way to get an Employee object is through the nested EmpolyeeBuilder
	 * class.
	 * </ul>
