/**
 * The state pattern deals with altering an objectâ€™s behaviour when its state
 * changes.
 * 
 * Imagine the case of a class responsible for generating user interface based
 * on the state. You got anonymous, logged-in and admin users.
 * 
 * We shall create an interface called GreetingState which defines the action of
 * drawing a html text with a welcome message to the user. There is going to be
 * a different implementation according to the states that we have.
